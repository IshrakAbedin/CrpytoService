# CryptoService

### A toy web server for simple encryption and decryption utilizing Oat++.

The project relies on [Premake 5](https://premake.github.io/) meta build system.

## *Libraries Used*

+ [Oat++ 1.3.0](https://github.com/oatpp/oatpp)
+ [Magic Enum 0.9.6](https://github.com/Neargye/magic_enum)
+ [toml++ 3.4.0](https://github.com/marzer/tomlplusplus)

C++ 20 or Higher is required to compile. This is currently only written for x64 systems and mainly tested on Windows. If you wish to run the project in Linux, you need to generate Linux specific libraries (and may be include headers as well) for Oat++. Follow their specific instructions for it.
